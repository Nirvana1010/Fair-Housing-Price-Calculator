## Overview
With the accuracy-based team ranking at the 399th place in Kaggle competition, we develop a house transaction price calculator for home sellers and seller agencies to mitigate the inaccurate estimation on sale price caused by information asymmetry existing in the housing market. For sellers, they are not confirmed on the expected sale price due to lack of professional knowledge and psychological factors. For seller agencies, their estimation for sale price is not as precise as expected. For accurate prediction, we take house features, market trading volume, macroeconomic and housing policy into consideration and utilize a stacking model. This model takes advantage of all outperformed machine learning (ML) models to maximize the prediction performance, which excels other ML methods in this study. It is found that the stacking model gives 47.84% more accuracy for sellers and 38.72% for seller agencies.
